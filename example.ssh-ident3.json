// ssh-ident3 configuration JSON file: .ssh-ident3.json

// Unlike pure JSON ssh-ident3 allows JavaScript comments as single lines
// inside the configuration file, but *not* multiline comments
// or trailing comments.
// This allows to place comments before settings or to outcomment a setting.

	// Following is an outcommented fake setting
	//"XYZ": 1
