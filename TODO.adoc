= To Do for ssh-ident3

== Main Tasks
* [ ] add ssh-ident functionality
** [x] dump configuration
** [ ] list identities
* [ ] add ssh-agent functionality
* [ ] add ssh-add functionality
* [ ] add ssh wrapper functionality

** [ ] functionality for ssh-add to load all keys. Idea: `-I <identity>`. Uppercase `i` instead of lowercase to force loading keys.

* [ ] ssh-askpass issue, empty environmnt, `env -i` https://github.com/ccontavalli/ssh-ident/pull/34 or https://github.com/ccontavalli/ssh-ident/issues/18 +
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME defines the base directory relative to which user-specific configuration files should be stored. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.config should be used.
* [ ] check `scp user:hostname` issue (colon?), https://github.com/ccontavalli/ssh-ident/issues/35
* [ ] check Windows support, issues came with https://github.com/ccontavalli/ssh-ident/commit/e6145bdf0a51c18157f097d01823a9e3017428d4
** [ ] Cygwin only?
